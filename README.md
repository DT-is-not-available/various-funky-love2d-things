A code editor written for love2d, no guarentee its 100% stable tho. Remember that the Issues tab exists. So if you find a bug, before you leave forever, please file a formal complaint.

### Features
- Selecting text by the character (something i dont see often)
- Copying, cutting, and pasting text (dont worry you can still use stackoverflow)
- Syntax highlighting (bring your own or look in examples)
- Customizable (dont like dark mode? try even darker mode)
- Nonexistant documentation (unless you have vscode or enjoy sifting through the source)
- Draw anywhere, any size (you arent forced to use it fullscreen)
- Doesn't override `love.*` functions (embed it wherever)
- 99% Control (little to no internals hidden)
- This list (i put a full 5 minutes into this)

### thinsg i want to do that i just havent yet
- Undo/Redo and undo history
- Draggable scrollbars
- Better documentation
- Double clicking to select word
- Tripple clicking to select line
- Ctrl + left/right to seek past a word
- Tab character instead of replacing with spaces
- Pressing Tab or Shift+Tab while in a selection indenting and dedenting respectively
- Various brackets and quotes auto placing the second one after the cursor
- Typing autocomplete

Feel free to make a PR for any of those things
